    <h2>Meet Babatunde FASAN</h2>
    <p>
      I am an Architect and Building Engineer from Osun State, Nigeria. My reputation 
      extends across the country, particularly in Lagos where many of my major 
      projects have been executed.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Known for being calm, straightforward, and focused, I combine architectural 
      creativity with engineering precision to design and build structures that last.  
      My practice is guided by <strong>innovation, precision, and integrity</strong>, 
      ensuring every client receives solutions that are both aesthetic and technically sound.
